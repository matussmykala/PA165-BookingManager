Pokemon

entity Pokemon
+ complete and well written documentation by JavaDoc
+ database constraints like @DecimalMin(value = "0") and @Column(unique = true)

DAO PokemonDao and PokemonDaoImpl
+ simple and generally good implementation
- PokemonDaoImpl class JavaDoc should have been placed above PokemonDao interface (it even states that the following class is an interface)
- DAO classes should probably not be @Transactional (transactions should be handled by other layers)
- Missing some methods like findAll() that would return all Pokemons from DB (not a part of CRUD, so no penalties)

test PokemonDaoTest
+ tests that check attributes constraints
- testCreate() Consider using @Rule ExpectedException instead of catching all exceptions using catch(Exception ignored) {}
- consider annotating test classes/test methods with Spring's @Transactional annotation that automatically creates a transaction at the beginning of a test method and rolls it back at its end, thus removing the need to manually delete all entities from DB after each test.
