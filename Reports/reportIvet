a) Checklist evaluation:
All parts of checklist have been met.

Total points: 10

b) General comments
Project is well – written. It contains intelligible comments and mostly it is easy for reading. It is seem to be well managed and because of this fact all members of group contributed similarly. 
However, there are three mistakes:
	1. Exceptions from Data Layer are not propagated (e.g. TrainerDaoImpl)
	2. In TrainerDaoNGTest there were working with Container Managed EntityManager but in setUpClass() and tearDownClass() they closed entity manager (which is not necessary)
	3. We are missing some attribute which shows difference between leader and trainer (e.g. “Booleans isLeader”), because according to use case diagram GymLeader can awardBandge but normal trainer not.

c) Strong points of the project: great Wiky! Everything is described totally clear.
d) Weaknesses of the project: testing should be improved. There is unused method setEntityManager in TrainerDaoNGTest. Be more careful about testing of critical parts of projects.
